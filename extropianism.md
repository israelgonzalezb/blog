# e/ex: effective extropianism

Extropianism is a philosophical school of thought that advocates for the use of technology to improve the human condition.

Technology should be used to overcome the most difficult challenges that humanity faces: poverty, disease, environmental degradation. We believe that technology can be used to extend human life, improve human intelligence, and create a more prosperous and sustainable world.

Extropy, the antithesis of entropy, is "the extent of a systemâ€™s intelligence, information, order, vitality, and capacity for improvement." Extropy is a fundamental property of the universe that can be increased through the use of technology.

## Extropianism is an extension of transhumanism.

We can and should use technology to improve ourselves. The human body is a machine we each own. We each have the right to improve our bodies through the use of technology, such as cybernetics and genetic engineering. Our minds can also be improved and extended through the use of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces. This is what we mean when we speak of an **exocortex**.

## Extropianism is an optimistic philosophy: the future is ours to build, and it is bright.

Technology can lead to a world where humans are free from disease, poverty, and environmental degradation. Technology can lead to the creation of a new kind of human, one that is smarter, stronger, and more capable than the human beings of today.

We count amongst us in spirit a number of prominent thinkers and scientists, including Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, and Marvin Minsky.

Under the banner of e/ex, we hope to introduce and discuss these possibilities with a new wave of forward thinkers. We intend to advance the conversation by focusing on practical applications of this hopeful philosophy, while leaning further into the political, societal and spiritual implications.

Tomorrow is coming. We hope to meet you there.
