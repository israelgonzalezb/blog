# e/ex: effective extropianism

Extropianism is a philosophical school of thought that advocates for the use of technology to improve the human condition.

We believe that technology can be used to extend human life, improve human intelligence, and create a more prosperous and sustainable world.

Technology should be used to overcome the most difficult challenges that humanity faces: poverty, disease, environmental degradation.

The term "extropy" was coined by Max More, one of the founders of extropianism. More defined extropy as "the measure of intelligence, information, energy, vitality, experience, diversity, opportunity, and capacity for growth."

Extropy is a fundamental property of the universe that can be increased through the use of technology.

Extropianism is an extension of transhumanism.

We can and should use technology to improve ourselves. We believe that the human body is a machine, and that we each have the right to improve our bodies through the use of technology, such as cybernetics and genetic engineering.

Our minds can also be improved and extended through the use of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interfaces. This is what we mean when we speak ofan *exocortex*.

Extropianism is an optimistic philosophy: the future is ours to build, and it is bright. Technology can lead to a world where humans are free from disease, poverty, and environmental degradation. Technology can lead to the creation of a new kind of human, one that is smarter, stronger, and more capable than the human beings of today.

We count amongst us a number of prominent thinkers and scientists, including Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, and Marvin Minsky.

Under the banner of e/ex, we hope to introduce and discuss these possibilities with a new wave of forward thinkers. We intend to move the conversation forward by focusing on practical applications of this hopeful philosophy, while leaning farther into the political, societal and spiritual implications.

I hope to meet you in our tomorrow.
